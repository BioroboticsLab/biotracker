We are assuming that you have a tracking experiment, want to start a trial and save the data afterwards.

1.  Load a medium (video, picture or camera stream)  
2.  Load a tracker (usually trackers are preloaded from the 'Plugins' directory)  
3.   Choose the desired tracker options
    (This often takes some time to figure out)
4.  Go to the Experiment tab and click 'Start a new trial'.
    (The video gets paused when you starta new trial)
5.	You can also setup a rectification in the 'Visualization options' tab
6.  Insert the objects to track if the tracker does not generate them automatically
    (If you want to track two objects, add two tracks by right clicking the video or using the button on the left toolbar)
7.  After you are done tracking, finalize and save the trial.
8.  The data is then written to a file.

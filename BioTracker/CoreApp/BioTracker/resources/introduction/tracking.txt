1.  Load a medium (video, picture or camera stream)  
2.  Load a tracker (usually trackers are preloaded from the 'Plugins' directory)  
3   Choose the desired tracker options
    (This often takes some time to figure out)
4.  Insert the objects to track if the tracker does not generate them automatically
    (If you want to track two objects, add two tracks by right clicking the video or using the button on the left toolbar)
5.  Go to the Experiment tab and Start a trial.
    (You can pause the video meanwhile)
6.  After you are done tracking, finalize the trial.
7.  The data is only then written to a file.
